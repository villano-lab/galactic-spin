# Overview
This is a repository for an interactive fitting graphic for galactic rotation curves.

# Abstract
*The following asbstract was written for a presentation which focused on the interactive fitting tool.*

“The orbital velocities of matter in galaxies clearly signal the existence of dark matter.” This is the stance of a large portion of the scientific community, but how can we really appreciate the reasons behind this statement and its implications? Our research focuses on understanding the mathematical modeling behind the orbital velocities of galactic matter.  By comparing our models to real galactic data, we can visualize both how a model using only luminous matter falls short and how including dark matter might bring our estimations of the galactic orbital velocities into alignment with measured values. We make our results accessible through a computer application that allows people to observe this modeling first hand regardless of their own math or physics background. Tools like the one we present can help the general public understand and appreciate the concepts behind dark matter and reduce the barrier to entry for early-career scientists trying to learn more about dark matter.

# Instructions
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/villano-lab/galactic-spin/master?filepath=galactic-spin-binder%2FNGC_5533%2FWidget_usingLibrary.ipynb)
<br /> To run the interactive fitting tool, click on the binder button above. Please be patient when waiting for the environment to load; it may take a few minutes. Once the notebook is open, in the top bar, select `Kernel`, then choose `Restart & Run All` and confirm. When both cells are finished running, a plot with sliders will appear beneath the visible code. Enjoy!

The above link is to a version of the notebook made specifically to be run on binder with minimal code visible.
